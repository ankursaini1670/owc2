                            <h3>STATIC WATER STORAGE:</h3>
                            <p>Every property to be protected by a fire protection system needs sufficient water which
                                should be available at all times to fight the fire. The static storage is provided at
                                the ground level and terrace level of
                                the building by means of water storage tanks. The storage is provided generally in such
                                a way that the municipal water
                                supply is first received in the fire static storage tank from where it overflows to the
                                domestic tank. This holds good for
                                overhead storage too. Thus water will always be available in the event of a fir e. The
                                capacity of the underground storage
                                is generally based on at least half an hour's stock of water at the rated draw-off by
                                the fire pump. This tank also serves
                                the purpose of a holding capacity into which water from tankers can be poured through an
                                arrangement of a fire brigade

                            <h3>PUMPING SYSTEM:</h3>
                            <p>The pumping system which is the heart of the installation consists of specialized pumps
                                (of
                                approved design) which are fully automated to ensure that water is available throughout
                                the system under the
                                recommended pressure at all times. Mere opening of a single hydrant landing valve outlet
                                will make water available to
                                fight the fire without having to run to the pump house to start the pump. The resultant
                                drop in pressure in the pipeline
                                automatically triggers a pressure switch which starts the pump. However, smaller systems
                                may not be required to be
                                automatic. The connection to the system is taken from two sub-stations with changeover
                                contacts. The Lift, the staircase
                                lighting and the fire fighting pump sets are connected in the above manner so that in
                                the event of fire, if the normal
                                source is destroyed, power will still be available through the change over contact.

                            <h3>EXTERNAL & INTERNAL PIPING: </h3>
                            <p> External piping is generally provided as a ring main surrounding the property from 
                                all sides. The ring main is usually pressurized with water so that in the event of fire, the opening of a single landing 
                                valve will make water under pressure available to fight the fire. Cut-off valves are provided in the ring main to enable 
                                the available water pressure to be concentrated at a desired location. At strategic points on the ring mains are provided 
                                hydrant stand posts. The hydrant stand post consists of a standpipe which is operated through a valve. Near the stand 
                                post, is placed a hose box containing one or two hose pipes for instantaneous coupling to it. The nozzle attached at the 
                                end of the hose delivers water at high pressure in the form of a jet that can be directed at the seat of the fire or at the 
                                roof of the building. The internal piping comprises of a riser pipe called the W et Riser which goes right up to the terrace 
                                of the building where it is connected to the overhead water storage. The riser which may be pressurized also acts as a 
                                down-take / down comer to serve the fire fighting operation as the need arises. At every floor, First Aid Hose Reels are 
                                provided which ensure that water will be available under pressure at all the corners of every room to fight the fire. The 
                                riser is also connected to the static fire storage tank at the terrace level through a Booster pump. The function of the 
                                Booster pump is to pump water from the overhead storage tank and supply the same through the down take at 
                                recommended pressure. The Booster pump is thus also available not only to boost the pressure but also to act as a 
                                hydrant pump should the main pump fail to operate and specially to fight the fire from within the building

                            <h3>SPRINKLER SYSTEMS:</h3>
                            <p>: A Sprinkler is a device connected to a pressurized network of piping and contains a glass 
                                bulb with a special chemical in it. Sprinklers are available at different ratings and operate at different temperatures. 
                                When a fire takes place, the resultant heat causes the temperature of the chemical in the glass bulb to rise up and 
                                expand. This causes the glass bulb to break and start a spray of water which covers a certain area below the sprinklers 
                                so that the fire is fought right when it starts. The sprinkler network is connected to sprinkler pump, which is connected 
                                to a mechanical alarm that rings as soon as the fire pump starts. Alarm rings the moment a single sprinkler operates, 
                                thus warning the occupants of an outbreak of fire. The electrical wiring is similar to the main fire pump. Sprinkler 
                                systems, by virtue of the fact that they are activated automatically as soon as a fire starts, prevent it's spreading further.
                                Thus the fire is localized and fought by the system without the help or assistance of occupants and is fully automatic. As 
                                the provision of the hydrant / sprinkler system is to help the occupants fight the fire till such a time that the local fire 
                                authority reaches the premises, the fire authorities fight the fire using the system provided and the equipment brought 
                                by them. The Fire tender consists of mobile water storage and associated pumping machinery should the premise's 
                                water storage get over. A fire brigade collective breaching is provided on the underground static storage tank with
                                instantaneous couplings mounted on them. W ater from the fire tenders can be off loaded to the under ground storage 
                                tank by means of hose pipes connected from the fire tender. Fire brigade inlet connection is provided outside the
                                building and near the riser, through a gate valve and a non - return valve. The pumps of the fire tender can be connected
                                to this inlet through which the water in the fire tender can be pumped up in the building to fight the fire.</p>

                            <h3>FIRE ALARM SYSTEMS:</h3>
                            <p> The Fire Alarm System comprises of a Main Control panel which is connected to a network 
                                of devices spread throughout the risk. The devices may be sprinklers, flame detectors, heat detectors, smoke detectors 
                                etc. Whenever a fire takes place, or smoke is generated, or heat is detected by any one of the detectors on the network, 
                                the Control Panel gives an audible alarm at the same time identifying the detector which has sent the signal. The alarm 
                                panel contains a diagram of the property and through an arrangement of classifying zones; it is possible t o identify the 
                                exact location where the problem has occurred. The alarm panel is a highly sophisticated intelligent control system 
                                which eliminates the possibilities of a false alarm. The panel also enables checking of the status of each detector from 
                                the control room itself. The position of each valve (whether open or closed), each section of detectors and the fact 
                                whether water is flowing through the pipe line the moment the system is activated or not, can be checked from the 
                                control panel. Hooters with Pill Boxes are provided on every floor in the building. When a fire occurs on a particular 
                                floor, the occupant breaks the glass of the Pill Box thus causing the Hooter to give a loud audible alarm. This alarm will 
                                also be reflected on the Main Control panel indicating its position, i. e; the floor at which the fire has started.
